## üåç Note for translators

Localization files are located in the [lib/l10n](lib/l10n) directory.

The app uses ARB format for localization. If you wonder how to format key-values content inside ARB files, [here](https://github.com/google/app-resource-bundle/wiki/ApplicationResourceBundleSpecification) is detailed explanation.

If you are making changes to the localization files, run the following command:

```
flutter gen-l10n
```

or use `Generate Localizations` button in VSCode when the file is open in the editor.

Detailed documentation about localization [here](https://docs.flutter.dev/ui/accessibility-and-internationalization/internationalization).

### Android localization

The original strings for translation are located in the [android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml](android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml) file. To translate, you need to create a directory with your localization code, for example: `android/app/src/main/res/values-ru/strings.xml`. More about localization in Android https://developer.android.com/training/basics/supporting-devices/languages.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to make changes in the code

### 1. Where to begin

Start by looking at the [open issues](https://github.com/proninyaroslav/blink-comparison/issues) to contribute code.

Make sure to write your name and e-mail address in format `Name <e-mail>` in the license declaration above every file you make changes to.

Repeat and rinse, if you send enough patches to demonstrate you have a good coding skills, you will be given commit access on the real repo, making you part of the development team.

Also, take a look at [**Coding Guidelines**](#-coding-guidelines) before making code changes.

### 2. After making changes

Be sure to run `build_runner` before creating your commit:

```
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

Detailed documentation on `build_runner` [here](https://pub.dev/packages/build_runner).

If you are making changes to the localization files, also read the [Note for translators](#-note-for-translators) section.

### 3. Testing

Make sure that all existing and new tests are passing:

```
flutter test test
```

## üìã Coding Guidelines

- Keep it snimple snupid: [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- No repeating yourself. [Re-use your own code and that of others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- If you want to help, triaging and keeping up with the issue and TODO list is great.
- Try to follow our coding style and formatting before submitting a patch.
- All merge requests should come from a feature branch created on your Git fork. Your code will be reviewed, and only merged to the master branch if it doesn't break the build.
- When you submit a merge request, try to explain what issue you're fixing, and what you're fixing in detail, so it's easier for us to read your patches.
- Well named methods and code re-usability is preferable to a lot of comments.
